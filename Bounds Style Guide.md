# Bounds Visual Hierarchy & Style Guide v1.0
*A formalization of Bounds' evolving art identity*

---

## 1. Three–Tier Visual Hierarchy

Bounds uses three layers of visual priority to maintain clarity and establish tone.

### **Tier 1 — Foreground Gameplay Elements (High Contrast / Pure Black Outline)**  
These shapes must always “pop” immediately because they impact gameplay.

**Includes:**
- Player  
- Platforms & solid geometry  
- Moveable cube  
- Buttons / pressure plates  
- Doors  
- Hazards (saws, lasers, etc.)  

**Stylistic Traits:**
- Thick **pure black outlines**  
- Light / high-value fills  
- Clean, readable silhouettes  
- Rounded corners (soft industrial look)  
- Minimal internal detail  

**Purpose:**  
Pure black = *interactivity*. Anything outlined in black can kill you, help you, or move.

---

### **Tier 2 — Attached Background Fixtures (Medium Contrast / Near-Black Outline)**  
Decorative, structural elements that add atmosphere without distracting from gameplay.

**Includes:**
- Vents (square, round, slatted)  
- Fans  
- Wall-mounted panels  
- Cables  
- Pipes  
- Cameras  
- Tech props / background machinery  

**Stylistic Traits:**
- Outlines use **near-black** (the grid color range)
- Softer contrast than gameplay objects  
- Simple geometric shapes  
- Slight inset shadows or slats for depth  
- Fill colors in medium greys, cold steels, desaturated tones  

**Purpose:**  
These should be readable and flavorful but *never compete* with Tier 1.

---

### **Tier 3 — Room Background / Environment (Low Contrast / No Outline)**  
The structural foundation of each chamber.

**Includes:**
- Blue steel wall backdrop  
- Grid pattern  
- Large background panels  
- Ambient shading  
- Soft AO baked into corners (optional later)

**Stylistic Traits:**
- No outlines  
- Subtle tonal variation  
- Low-contrast, unobtrusive  
- Must recede visually  

**Purpose:**  
A calm backdrop that lets every other layer pop naturally.

## 2. Contrast Rules

### **Pure Black = Interactive**
Used only for:
- Player outline  
- Cube outline  
- Platform borders  
- Hazard outlines  
- Door frame / rails  
- Buttons  

### **Near Black = Decorative Structure**
Used for:
- Vent rims  
- Pipe housings  
- Panel borders  
- Camera elements  
- Small grates and slats  

### **Mid-Tones = Material Surfaces**
Used for:
- Panels  
- Metal plates  
- Fan blades  
- Slat faces  

### **Blue-Steel = Room Background**
Your defining wall color.  
Low noise, neutral, desaturated.

## 3. Shape Language

Bounds has a very recognizable shape identity:

### **Player**
- Circular  
- Squash/stretch  
- Expressive leaning & eyes  

### **Platforms**
- Rounded rectangles  
- Thick black outlines  
- Simple planar faces  

### **Doors**
- Rectangular with softened corners  
- Clean, industrial, controlled  

### **Decorations**
- Rounded metal housings  
- Clean circles, rectangles, ducts  
- Soft corners, modern sci-fi design  

**Overall:**  
The world is industrial, but friendly.

## 4. Line Weight Rules

### **Gameplay Outlines**
- Thick, pure black  
- Consistent across all active elements  

### **Background Fixture Outlines**
- Slightly thinner  
- Near-black (not pure black)  

### **Environment**
- No outlines  
- Soft grid & paneling  

This is the foundation of Bounds’ depth readability.

## 5. Color Palette

### **Foreground Fills**
- Soft white (#ECF7FF) — player, cube  
- Light grey — platforms, buttons  

### **Wall Color**
- Blue steel (approx. #526572)  
- Muted, desaturated, calming  

### **Decoration Colors**
- Medium grey steels  
- Dark grills  
- Near-black outlines  

### **Accent Colors**
- Muted red (#C15A5A) — buttons, LED  
- Occasional warm lights  
- Avoid bright hues unless they have gameplay meaning  

---

## 6. Texture Philosophy

Bounds intentionally avoids noisy or realistic texturing.

**Uses:**
- Simple flat fills  
- Slight shading via shape  
- Subtle layering  
- Clean geometry  

**Avoids:**
- Grunge  
- Noise  
- Heavy gradients  
- Busy patterning  

The clean aesthetic makes the character and movement shine.

## 7. Animation Philosophy

### **Player Animations**
- Squash/stretch  
- Eye tracking  
- Idle breathing  
- Dust puffs  

### **Hazard Animations**
- Smooth rotation  
- Sine-wave motion  
- Crisp timing  

### **Background Animations**
- Minimal  
- Subtle ambient movement (fans, cables, lights)  

Everything moves with intention and softness.

## 8. Environmental Storytelling

Bounds’ world is:
- Clean  
- Controlled  
- Slightly whimsical  
- Industrial but not oppressive  
- Clinical but not sterile  
- Techy but cozy  

Decorations imply:
- Airflow  
- Maintenance ducts  
- Surveillance  
- Industrial design  

Everything feels intentional, not cluttered.

## 9. New Prop Creation Checklist

When creating new assets:

### ✔ Is it gameplay-related?  
Use pure black outlines.

### ✔ Is it decorative?  
Use near-black outlines and muted fills.

### ✔ Does it visually compete with gameplay?  
If yes → lower contrast or simplify.

### ✔ Does the shape follow the rounded, clean language?  
If not → soften corners.

### ✔ Is the detail level appropriate?  
Simple → Tier 2  
Ultra simple → Tier 3  
Strong detail → Tier 1 (if interactive)
